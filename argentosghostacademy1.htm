<h4 align="center">What Is A Haunting?</h4>
<p>A haunting can take the form of a few different occurences. The most common being a residual haunting, which is like a video being replayed, in this scenario it is a past event continuously being played over and over again. It is not an intelligent haunting, moreover, just a repeat event that cannot communicate intelligently with the living but it can be seen or heard. These events commonly repeat when the event would have contained an eruption of negative energy, an event that would have been hugely traumatic to those involved. That energy is then imprinted within the walls of the location in which it occured. Another theory is that residual hauntings occur more frequently near water, as it is believed the water has a way of storing the energy that is released from these events and replaying it to the living. <br /><br />Another type of haunting is one that can intelligently communicate with the living. This is the type of haunting where the spirit will try to get your attention by making sounds, moving objects, appearing in dreams, appearing in a physical form, manipulating electrical equipemnt. In other words, it wants to make it's presence known, this could be to give a message across or because it is trapped in our dimension. This type of haunting is not necessarily bad, it could be a loved one checking in or a good spirit attached to the property. However, it can also be quite the opposite and cause unspoken fear and spread oppressive energy to the occupants. A negative entity usually haunts a location when a traumatic event occured or when invited into the location by the living, for example, the use of a oujia bored or the use of demonic curses. They will feed off of the fear of the occupants and will become stronger as time goes on. The stronger the spirit becomes the more frequent and violent the haunting becomes. This type of haunting can have drastic effects on the living including full blown posession causing the occupants to act in ways that they would not usually. Such hauntings can be classed as demonic hauntings as the evil spirits attempt to do all they can to bring the occupants down.</p>
<h4 align="center">How To Gather Evidence Of A Haunting?</h4>
<p align="center">Firstly, it is important to decipher the type of haunting you have. Does the same thing happen over and over at the same time? If so, it is a residual haunting which can then be captured via audio and video devices. You can record the noises of the haunting taking place or film the same objects moving at a certain time. This haunting is not intelligent therefore it will not respond to provocation but can still be captured by recording the re-occuring event. <br /><br />If the haunting is intellgient there are numerous ways to gather evidence, however, it is important to understand the purpose of this evidence. We are not trying to communicate with the spirit, rather, confirming that it is there and documenting evidence of this. <br /><br />The most common way to gather evidence is with a mobile phone, you can record audio, videos and the photos with the hope the spirit will make itself known. Before recording, it is useful to ask the spirit a question and give it time to respond. Usually you will not hear the answer with your own ears but will hear the answer on play back of the recording. This is classed as electronic voice phenomena (EVP), it is a way for the spirit to tap into various sound waves so that we can hear them speak on playback. You can also ask the spirit to move something which could be captured on video or by motion detector.</p>

<h4 align="center">What Do You Do If You Are Really Haunted?</h4>
<p align="center">If you have captured evidence that confirms you are haunted, you must decide if the spirit is a positive entity or one set to cause harm. If the spirit is positive, you may wish to leave things as they are, however, it is still recommended you aid in removing the spirit as they are not meant to belong with the living. This can be done on your own accord with a cleansing ceremony and stating your intentions to the spirit. <br /><br />However, if the spirit is evil, you cannot remove this yourself. It requires people of power within the religious sector to perform a real exorcism of the house. If you attempt to remove an evil spirit without the experience required, it will likely grow stronger and will now be angered. The same will happen with just leaving the spirit to it's own free will. Evil sprits are highly dangerous and you must seek help immediately.</p>
